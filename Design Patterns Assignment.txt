Describe what is the primary problem you are trying to solve. (P1)
How to take a credit card number and determine which carrier it is as well as how to create an object based off of that. 
Describe what are the secondary problems you try to solve (if there are any). (P2/P3)
How to create a java object based on the creditcard number

Describe what design pattern(s) you use how (use plain text and/or diagrams). 

Perhaps a factory method patern or strategy pattern
Describe the consequences of using this/these pattern(s).


Implement the solution in Java
Use one of the following:
Array of Strings containing credit numbers, for example:
String[] lines = {“5100123412341234,07/22,John Doe”, “x”};
Reading a text file containing credit card details, for example:
5100123412341234,07/22,John Doe
601112341234123,09/23,Jane Doe
Create your own additional test cases.
Sample output:
MasterCard: 5100123412341234,07/22,John Doe
Unable to instantiate from known credit types: 601112341234123,09/23,Jane Doe
